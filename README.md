# Ibot

Based on [slackbot](https://github.com/trinchan/slackbot), but completely
reworked and functionality ripped out. Its only dependency outside the core
library is [schema](https://github.com/gorilla/schema).

It works (currently) only via Outgoing Webhook on Slack.

The bot responds to commands starting with `!` after that commands a subcommands
for instance `!help` to give a list of supported commands.

## Running

`./ibot -token <domain:token>`
